```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
choco <- read.csv("https://xdaiisu.github.io/ds202materials/hwlabs/choco.csv")
```


1)
```{r}
hist(choco$Rating)
```

The distribution of the chocolate ratings is skewed slightly to the left with a majority of the chocolate ratings falling in the 2.5 to 3.5 range. No ratings are visible in the 4 to 4.5 range, and very few, possibly outliers, fall in the 4.5 to 5 range.

2)
```{r}
plot(choco$Cocoa.Pct, choco$Rating)
```

Since there is no clear trend in the scatter plot shown above, the rating doesn't appear to rely on the percentage of cocoa in a piece of chocolate. As the percentage of cocoa increases, the distribution of ratings remains fairly constant, indicating no clear relationship.
